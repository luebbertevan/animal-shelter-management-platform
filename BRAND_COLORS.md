## Implementation Notes

1. **Treat logo groupings as "roles," not just colors** — Each color group has a specific purpose based on its role in the logo.

2. **Maintain hierarchy** — Use structure colors (cyan family) for layout, brand voice (green) for communication, and action colors (orange) sparingly for emphasis.

3. **Preserve contrast** — Ensure text remains readable against backgrounds, especially when using the very dark gray (`#1A1A1A`) on light backgrounds.

4. **Use warmth sparingly** — The light orange (`#DAB5A0`) should be used subtly for emotional support, not as a primary action color.

5. **Reserve urgency colors** — Orange and vivid orange should be used intentionally to maintain their power and draw attention when needed.
