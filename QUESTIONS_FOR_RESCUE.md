# Questions for Rescue Team — Data & Workflow Clarification

## Animal Status & Transfers

1. **Animal Status:**

    - Do you need a status for animals that aren't in your shelter yet? (e.g., "transferring" from another shelter, waiting to be picked up)
    - Are there other statuses we should include beyond: Needs Foster, In Foster, Adopted, Medical Hold, In Shelter?
    - **"Needs Foster" as status:** We're noticing that "Needs Foster" describes a need rather than a location/status. An animal could be "In Shelter" AND also need a foster, or "Transferring" AND also need a foster. Should "Needs Foster" be:
        - A separate status option (current approach)?
        - A separate field/tag that can be combined with location status (e.g., "In Shelter + Needs Foster")?
        - Something else?

2. **Transfer Process:**
    - When an animal is being transferred from another shelter, at what point do you add them to the system?
    - Do you track where they're coming from during the transfer?

## Dates & Timing

3. **Intake Date:**

    - Is there a difference between when an animal physically arrives ("incoming date") and when you add them to your system ("intake date")?
    - Or are these the same thing and we can just use one "intake date"?

4. **Age Tracking:**
    - How do you typically handle age when you don't have a date of birth?
    - Do you estimate in weeks/months/years, or just "kitten" vs "adult"?
    - Should "senior" be a separate category from "adult"?

## Medical & Behavioral Information

5. **Medical Needs:**

    - When you create a placement request, do the medical needs sometimes differ from the animal's general medical record? (e.g., "needs medication during foster period" vs "has ongoing condition")
    - Or are they usually the same?

6. **Behavioral Assessment:**

    - Do you assess socialization on a scale (like 1-5), or is it more like "needs socialization" vs "socialized"?
    - When do you typically do behavioral assessments? At intake or later?

7. **Spay/Neuter Status:**
    - Do you track this as: Fixed, Not Fixed, or Unknown/Not Set?
    - Is it important to distinguish between "spayed" (female) and "neutered" (male), or is "fixed" enough?

## Tags & Filtering

8. **Animal Tags:**

    - What tags/categories do you use most often for filtering? (e.g., "fine with dogs", "bottle fed", "kid friendly", "needs socialization")
    - Are there other important tags we should include?

9. **Missing Information:**
    - When viewing an animal profile, is it helpful to see a list of what information is still missing? (e.g., "needs: vaccines, photos, behavioral assessment")
    - Or is it obvious from the empty fields and we don't need to highlight it separately?

## Placement Requests

10. **Placement Request Description:**

    -   What kind of information goes in the "description" field for a placement request?
    -   Is it different from the animal's general notes?

11. **Priority/Urgency:**

    -   When marking a placement request as "high priority," what makes it high priority?
    -   Is this the same as "urgent," or are they different?

12. **Medical Needs vs Special Care:**
    -   In placement requests, is there a difference between "medical needs" and "special care notes"?
    -   Or are they the same thing?

## Intake Types

13. **Intake Types:**
    -   What are the most common ways animals come in? (e.g., surrender, transfer from another shelter, rescue)
    -   Are there other intake types we should include?

## Petstablished Integration

14. **What information needs to sync with Petstablished?**

    -   Which fields should be synced? (e.g., name, breed, status, photos)
    -   When should sync happen? (automatically on update, or manual trigger)
    -   What information changes require updating Petstablished? (e.g., status changes, new photos, medical updates)

15. **Petstablished Workflow:**
    -   Do you add animals to Petstablished at the same time you add them to this system, or later?
    -   When you update information in this app, do you always need to update Petstablished too, or only for certain fields?

## Photos

16. **Photo Organization:**
    -   Do photos need to be associated with specific animals or groups, or is it obvious from context?
    -   Do you need to add descriptions to photos, or is it clear what they show?

## Groups & Relationships

17. **Animal Groups:**

    -   When you have a litter or group, do you always create individual profiles for each animal, or sometimes just a group profile?
    -   Do group photos need to be separate from individual animal photos?

18. **Family Relationships:**
    -   How important is it to track parent/child or sibling relationships?
    -   Is this mainly for litters, or do you track other family connections?

## Foster Assignments

19. **Foster Tracking:**
    -   Do you need to track which foster is currently assigned to each animal in the animal record itself?
    -   Or is that tracked separately in assignments?

## General Workflow

20. **Data Entry:**

    -   When you get a bulk intake (like a large rescue shipment), how much information do you typically have initially?
    -   What's the minimum information you need to create an animal profile? (e.g., just species and source?)

21. **Information Updates:**

    -   What information changes most frequently? (e.g., status, weight, medical notes)
    -   What information rarely changes once set? (e.g., breed, source)

22. **What information is most critical for day-to-day operations?**
    -   What do coordinators need to see immediately when viewing an animal?
    -   What can be hidden or shown at the bottom if it's missing?
